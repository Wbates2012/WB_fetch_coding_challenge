# Coding Exercise

Thank you for reading my submission for the Analytics Engineer Coding Exercise.

## First: Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model
You can find my ER diagram [here](https://github.com/Wbates2012/WB_fetch_coding_challenge/blob/main/ER_diagram.png). I used the website draw.io to build it.

## Second: Write Queries that Directly Answer Predetermined Questions from a Business Stakeholder
I wrote the SQLite queries after cleaning the data and building the database so that it would be more efficient and robust. You can find the queries at the end of [this notebook](https://github.com/Wbates2012/WB_fetch_coding_challenge/blob/main/fetch%20coding%20test.ipynb).

## Third: Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided
I evaluated data quality issues in the same notebook, found [here](https://github.com/Wbates2012/WB_fetch_coding_challenge/blob/main/fetch%20coding%20test.ipynb). I used Python for this part of the exercise.

## Fouth: Communicate with Stakeholders
